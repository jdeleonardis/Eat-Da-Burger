## Description
This project represents homework 13.  At its base level, it is simply getting a list of burgers from a mysql database, and displaying if they need to be eaten.  However, it incorporates several concepts learned including handlebars, views, object relational mapper (ORM), model view controller (MVC) and restful APIS (put and delete being 'new' to the course).
